## ContentEngine
An AI engine to automate rich content creation (e.g., character behaviors, world events) by structuring and reasoning about data. Aimed at game development and creative workflows.

(Actively under development!)

### Core Philosophy

We believe that by deeply structuring information with AI and performing insightful reasoning upon it, we can achieve:

*   **Automated Content Creation**: Automatically extract and organize key information from raw data (text, images, logs, etc.).
*   **Targeted Information Management**: Build indexes and relationships based on structured data for easy querying and management.
*   **Driving Emergent Experiences**: Generate complex behaviors and content beyond manual design by reasoning about relationships and interactions between different structured data points using AI.
*   **Empowering Creators**: Provide content generation "Sparks" to assist the creative process.

### Core Features (Planned)

*   **Multi-modal Data Understanding**: Support processing various data inputs like text and images.
*   **Customizable Structuring**: Allow users to define target data structures (e.g., character cards, event templates).
*   **AI-Driven Structuring**: Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI techniques for data extraction and transformation.
*   **Structured Data Storage**: Provide efficient data storage and indexing solutions.
*   **Reasoning Engine**: Perform logical reasoning, relationship inference, and behavior prediction based on structured data.
*   **Offline Content Generation**: Support generating content locally without requiring constant network connectivity.
*   **Engine Configuration Asset Integration**: Support adding plugin interfaces in the engine to import structured configuration assets.

### Example Application Scenarios

*   **Game Content Generation**: For games like pet simulators, automatically extract character cards, infer ecological behaviors, group relationships, environmental interactions, etc., to generate rich world content.
*   **Knowledge Management & Reasoning**: Automatically organize and reason about various knowledge bases, encyclopedias, setting collections, etc.
*   **Creator Tools**: Provide content structuring and reasoning support for novelists, scriptwriters, and world-builders.

Taking game atmosphere design as an example, ContentEngine can:

1.  **Extract Standard Information**: Starting from brief character design discussions by designers, assist in generating/completing standardized character cards containing personality traits, living habits, etc.
2.  **Establish Data Relationships**: Create connections and indexes between data entities like characters, activities, and player behaviors.
3.  **Perform Ecological Reasoning**:
    *   `Character Traits + Activity` -> Infer NPC behavior patterns under specific game activities based on their traits (and generate structured AI resources to drive them).
    *   `NPC + NPC` -> Pre-generate multiple usable interaction presets based on NPC social and competitive relationships to present to the player.
    *   `NPC + Player Behavior` -> Generate more natural, contextually relevant NPC dialogues based on the player's likely activity context.

Through low-cost AI preprocessing, the game world can "autonomously" derive details and dynamic changes far beyond manual scope, providing players with continuous novelty.

(Of course, without a robust data-driven game AI behavior framework and a data-sensitive gameplay context framework, it's all for naught.)

### Technology Stack

*   The core is a backend application driven by **Blazor Server** (a Unity developer's excessive attachment to C#, hoping not to be backstabbed by Microsoft), facilitating collaboration scenarios in enterprise LANs.
*   Future considerations for optimizing deployment and data services (still a long way off).
